# Physics Ball Simulation

So you know those viral videos which have millions of videos on channels like https://www.youtube.com/@Satisfying_Shape5 or https://www.youtube.com/@JacksPhysics-fp1cx?
I made that - in Javascript - and public for all of you to use.
Not only that - I minimised the amount of programming you need to do by adding UI controls on the webpage itself so you can modify the simulation right from your web browser.
You're welcome.
